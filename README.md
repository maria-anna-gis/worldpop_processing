# WorldPop Age and Gender Structures Processing

This repo focuses on the processing, visualisation, and analysis of WorldPop Age and Gender Structures data through comprehensive Jupyter notebooks and associated tools. The repository provides a complete workflow for handling demographic data from the WorldPop project, enabling the extraction of insights from population distribution datasets.

## Data Sources

This project utilises datasets from the WorldPop project, specifically focusing on Age and Gender Structure datasets
For accessing WorldPop data, visit [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/organization/worldpop?dataseries_name=WorldPop+-+Age+and+Gender+Population+Structures) or [worldpop.org](https://www.worldpop.org) to learn more about the latest datasets and documentation.

## Usage

The notebooks are designed to be run sequentially, with each notebook building upon the outputs of previous processing steps.

Begin by running the contents of NB1 in VSC or Jupyter Lab, before moving on to NB2, which is designed specifically for ArcGIS Pro due to its reliance on ArcPy.

Each notebook contains detailed documentation explaining the methodology, data sources, and expected outputs. Code cells include comments describing processing steps and analytical decisions.



## Data Citation

When using outputs from this repository, please cite the relevant WorldPop datasets and acknowledge the processing methodologies developed in this project.
